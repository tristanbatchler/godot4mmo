This is a reboot of the original 
[Godot Python MMO](https://tbat.me/projects/godot-python-mmo-tutorial-series) project. This time, 
I will be using everything I have learned, as well as community suggestions, to make a better 
version of the game using Godot 4 for the front end, and more modern Python frameworks for the 
backend.
